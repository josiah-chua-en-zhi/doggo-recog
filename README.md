# Overview
This personal MLOps project is to implement an end-to-end pipeline to create a telegram bot that uses deep learning to differentiate dog breeds.
The main objectives are to test the effectiveness of Neptune AI, an ML model monitoring and storage system, and familiarise myself with PyTorch Lightning a Pytorch wrapper package that allows for faster implementation of training deep learning models.
